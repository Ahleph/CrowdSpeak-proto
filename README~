Crowdspeak is a local-area messaging app.

Its part twitter, part reddit, and part GPS-based communication.
Like twitter, only short text messages are allowed.
Like Reddit, messages can be up/downvoted, as well as commented on.

Initially, each message is only visible in the vicinity on the original sender, according to his GPS coordinates. Each person who sees the message, and upvotes it, will begin to broadcast the message as well, propogating the message to a larger area. The message can thus be seen in range of all upvoters as well as the original broadcaster.

Ideally, good ideas will be upvoted and spread around, while unpopular messages will die from not being seen. This will allow large groups of people to communicate and come to a "concensus" in realtime.


I see applications for this app wherever there exists a group of people. Whether there's a political rally, a rock concert, or even across a downtown, the crowd WILL be heard.
